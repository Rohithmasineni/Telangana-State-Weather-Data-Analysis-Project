# Telangana-State-Weather-Data-Analysis-Project

### Project Overview
This project involves analyzing weather data from Telangana, India, for the period January 2021 to April 2024. Using Power BI, I explored trends and patterns across key weather parameters, such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed, to draw actionable insights for better understanding and decision-making.

### Data Description
The dataset contains hierarchical weather data, including:

District: Geographical identifier.

Mandal: Sub-regional identifier.

Date: Daily records for time-series analysis.

Weather Metrics: Rain (mm), Min/Max Temperature (Â°C), Min/Max Humidity (%), Min/Max Wind Speed (Kmph).

Initial dataset: 10 columns, 7,20,527 rows

Post-cleaning: 11 columns, 6,58,465 rows

### Key Business Problems Addressed
Rainfall Analysis: Distribution, trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies.
Temperature Insights: Seasonal variations, trends, and extreme events.
Humidity Patterns: Seasonal changes, trends, and anomalies.
Wind Speed Analysis: Variations, trends, and outliers.
Comprehensive Weather Insights: Dashboard creation, parameter relationships, and anomaly detection.

### Data Cleaning & Transformation
Removed null values and irrelevant columns.
Applied filters for data sorting.
Changed data types for consistency.

### Visualizations
Key insights were presented using:

Line Charts: Trend analysis and anomalies.
Stacked Charts: Comparative analysis.
Heat Maps: Data distribution.
Slicers and Tables: Interactive exploration.
Cards: Count of districts and mandals.

### Insights & Deliverables
Seasonal trends and anomalies across weather metrics.
Regional variations in rainfall, temperature, and wind speed.
Interactive dashboards with slicers for dynamic data exploration.
